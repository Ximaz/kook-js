# Kook JS

A Javascript SDK to program bots and webhooks for the Kook (kaiheila) application.

# TODO :

Once types are all implemented, repass on each of them, and when a property is
a Kook object, construct it using new, and if it's a list of Kook object,
construct them using a loop, so that it's easier to inherit the may-be-implemented
methods for those custom types.
